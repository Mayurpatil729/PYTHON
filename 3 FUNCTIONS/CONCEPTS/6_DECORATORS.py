#! Function Decorators:
# Decorator is a function which can take a function as argument and extend its functionality
# and returns modified function with extended functionality.
# The main objective of decorator functions is we can extend the functionality of existing
# functions without modifies that function.


#! Decorator Chaining
# We can define multiple decorators for the same function and all these decorators will
# form Decorator Chaining.
