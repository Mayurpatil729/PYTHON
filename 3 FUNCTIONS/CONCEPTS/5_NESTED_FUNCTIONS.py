#! Nested Functions:
# We can declare a function inside another function, such type of functions are called Nested
# functions.

# Note: A function can return another function.


# ? What is the differenece between the following lines?
#  f1 = outer
#  f1 = outer()
# In the first case for the outer() function we are providing another name f1(function aliasing).
# But in the second case we calling outer() function,which returns inner function.For that inner
# function() we are providing another name f1
# Note:  We can pass function as argument to another function
# Eg:  filter(function,sequence)
#      map(function,sequence)
#      reduce(function,sequence)
