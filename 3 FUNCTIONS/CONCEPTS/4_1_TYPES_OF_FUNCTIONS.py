'''             Recursive Functions                     '''

# A function that calls itself is known as Recursive Function.

# The main advantages of recursive functions are:
# 1. We can reduce length of the code and improves readability
# 2. We can solve complex problems very easily.


# Anonymous Functions:
# Sometimes we can declare a function without any name, such type of nameless functions 
# are called anonymous functions or lambda functions.
# The main purpose of anonymous function is just for instant use(i.e for one time usage)


# Normal Function:
# We can define by using def keyword.


# def squareIt(n):
#  return n*n


# lambda Function:
# We can define by using lambda keyword
# lambda n: n*n
# Syntax of lambda Function:
# lambda argument_list: expression

# Note: By using Lambda Functions we can write very concise code so that readability of
# the program will be improved.

# Note:
# Lambda Function internally returns expression value and we are not required to write
# return statement explicitly.

# Note: Sometimes we can pass function as argument to another function. In such cases
# lambda functions are best choice.
# We can use lambda functions very commonly with filter(), map() and reduce() functions, b'z
# these functions expect function as argument.
