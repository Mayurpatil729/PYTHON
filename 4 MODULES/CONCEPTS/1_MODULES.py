#! MODULES
# A group of functions, variables and classes saved to a file, which is nothing but module.
# Every Python file(.py) acts as a module.

# Note:
# whenever we are using a module in our program, for that module compiled file will be
# generated and stored in the hard disk permanently.


#! Reloading a Module:
# By default module will be loaded only once eventhough we are importing multiple
# multiple times


#! Finding members of module by using dir() function:
# dir() ===>To list out all members of current module
# dir(moduleName)==>To list out all members of specified module
