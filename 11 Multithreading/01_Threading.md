## Multi Threading 
Executing several tasks simultaneously is the concept of multitasking.
There are 2 types of Multi Tasking
1. Process based Multi Tasking
2. Thread based Multi Tasking

1. Process based Multi Tasking:
Executing several tasks simmultaneously where each task is a seperate independent process is 
called process based multi tasking.
: OS level

2. Thread based MultiTasking:
Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent part of the 
same program, is called Thread based multi tasking, and each independent part is called a Thread.
Thread is a part of process.

 Where ever a group of independent jobs are available, then it is highly recommended to 
execute simultaneously instead of executing one by one.For such type of cases we should go for 
Multi Threading.

Every Python Program by default contains one thread which is nothing but MainThread.

We can create a thread in Python by using 3 ways
1. Creating a Thread without using any class
2. Creating a Thread by extending Thread class
