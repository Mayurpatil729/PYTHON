⟫⇛                           OOPS                                     ⇚⟪

1. In Python every thing is an object. To create objects we required some Model or Plan or Blue 
print, which is nothing but class.
2. We can write a class to represent properties (attributes) and actions (behaviour) of object.
3. Properties can be represented by variables
4.Actions can be represented by Methods.


CLASS IS AN BLUEPRINT/PLAN/MODEL/DESIGN FOR AN OBJECT.
OBJECT IS A PYSICAL EXITETANCE OF A CLASS.

SYNTAX:

class name_of_class:        //class name starts with capital letter in oops
    '''doc string''''
    properties (variables)
    actions (methods)

How to create in python:
    reference variable=classname()
 

Every object has properties and behaviour.
-------------------------------------------
1. Properties(data) are specified by Variables
2. Behaviour can be specified by Methods

3 Types of variables:
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Instance variables (Object level variables)
2. Static Variables (Class level variables)
3. Local Variables (Methed level variables)

3 Types of Methods:
------------------------------------
1. Instance Methods
2. Class methods
3. static methods

==> Functions which are defined in class is called as methods.

⟫⇛ Reference variable can be used to refer objects.
⟫⇛ By using reference vaFiab1e, we can invoke functionlaity of object.
⟫⇛ For a single object, there may a chance of multiple references.
⟫⇛ purpose of reference variable is we can access members/variables of objecs
