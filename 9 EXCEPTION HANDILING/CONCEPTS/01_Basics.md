## Exception Handling

1. Syntax Errors :The errors which occurs because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.
2. Runtime Errors : Also known as exceptions.
   While executing the program if something goes wrong because of end user input or
   programming logic or memory problems etc then we will get Runtime Errors.

Exception Handling concept applicable for Runtime Errors but not for syntax error

An unwanted and unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of program is called
exception.
Exception handling does not mean repairing exception. We have to define alternative way to continue rest of the program normally.

Every Exception in Python is a class. 
All exception classes are child classes of BaseException.i.e every exception class extends 
BaseException either directly or indirectly. Hence BaseException acts as root for Python
